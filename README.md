# Complementary probability calculator
Takes in a percentage and number of attempts to calculate what the probability of that event happening

## Example
```
chance = 10%
attempts = 10


Probability of the event not happening = 90% or 0.9

The probability of the event not happening in all ten trials is (0.9)^10, which is approximately 0.3487.

1 - 0.3487 = 0.6513 or 65.13%.

So the final answer is 65.13%
