# Complementary probability calculator
Takes in a percentage and number of attempts to calculate what the probability of that event happening

## Example
```
chance = 10%
attempts = 5


Probability of the event not happening = 90% or 0.9

The probability of the event not happening in all five trials is (0.9)^5, which is approximately 0.59049.

1 - 0.59049 = 0.40951 or 40.951%.

So the final answer is 40.951%
