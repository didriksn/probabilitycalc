# Complementary probability calculator
Takes in a percentage and number of attempts to calculate what the probability of that event happening

## Example
```
chance = 10%
attempts = 5
Probability of the event not happening = 0.9 (90%)

(probability of not hapening)^attempts = 0.59049

1 - 0.59049 = 0.40951 or 40.951%.

So the final answer is 40.951%
